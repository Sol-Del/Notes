# Notes
## Email Security (Proofpoint)
### Protection Server Foundations Level 1
#### Message Flow
- Protection server filters messages that arrive and only accepts messages that meet criteria set by admin
- Diagram structure:

- From internal mail server to Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) to Mail Exchange record (MX). 
- This record specifies server on the internet responsible for accepting email messages on behalf of receiver server. 
- With info gathered from DNS sending MTA can reach receiving MTA Proofpoint protection serer acts as MTA then sends to mail server then to receiver. 
- The Protection Server is an email security gateway, which does what the name suggests; it provides a gateway for processing and filtering email to protect your users and your network from threats and attacks sent via email.
- Without email security gateway users exposed to spam, fraud/spoofs, harmful attachments/links, viruses, email loads

#### SMTP and Filtering

 - Connection: Sender reaches out to receiver, checks if they are supposed to reject messages, verify the IP belongs to it, check reputation within the Protection server 
- Envelope: Shows where message is from and who it is for, protection server checks all of those
- Body: MTA lets protection server know they are going to send message; Protection server gives rules for sender to follow. Protection servers checks message and looks for any malicious things
- What they contain
  - Header: Within the body of message, bad guys can spoof header to pretend its from somewhere safe.
  - Connection: Sender HELO domain, sender IP address, sender host name
  - Envelope: Sender email address, recipient host name
  - Body: Message Size, attachment attributes, message text content
  - Header: Subject, from, date, to 
 
### Protection Server Administration Level 1
#### Cluster & Modules
- Cluster = Master + Agents (# of agents depends)
- The agents filter and relay the messages, and the master provides centralized configuration and administration through the web-based management interface.
- Module is an app that performs specific filtering task
- Making changes to policy or anything do so on master
- Cluster can be on-prem or virtual. Can Configure and manage cluster from Master server
- On Prem:
  - Filtering agents first contacts for inbound messages MX records point to clusters
  - Master Never handles mail directly, once scanned by Filtering agents then sent to internal mail server then to user
  - These ports need to be open for Master server and Agents to communicate (usually of different networks separated by firewall)
  - Ports: 
    - Configuration 10000
  	- Database 3306
  	- Logs 10010
    - Master needs to talk to Proofpoint Update server (needs outbound access SSL 443) for updates
- Proofpoint On Demand: Proofpoint hosted option
 - Cluster in Proofpoint Data center, MX record points to Proofpoint IP
 - Modules: software plugins essentially, add new features to protection server
 - 6 Modules
    - Email firewall Module: Filters in-bound messages by connection and envelope attributes
    - Virus Protection module: uses virus definitions and heuristics to detect messages containing infection
    - Spam Detection Module: Uses Proofpointâ€™s proprietary MLX tech to classify inbound messages as spam
    - Regulatory Compliance Module: Ensure that outbound messages comply with privacy-related regulations
    - TAP Module: Targeted Attack Protection inspects attachments and URLs for threats
    - Digital Assets Module: Scans outbound messages for confidential or proprietary info

#### User Management
- User repository: data base on the protection server that contains the info about users in the org. Use it to organize users and give them group and individual settings
- Recipient Verification Overview: filtering & processing a message and uses resources. Checks the intended recipient against the user repository
- Email Filtering: can apply firewall rules to groups by grouping individuals in the user repository 

#### End User Services
- End User Digest overview: provides user with list of messages that have been sent to quarantine, helps filter and false positives by seeing digest
- End User web app overview: allows a user to edit their safe and block lists, views their quarantine and release messages, manage encryption keys for messages

#### TAP
- URL defense: when msg contains embedded link protection server will analyze link
- If the URL's status is unknown, the user will be allowed to the site while the URL is further evaluated, and a reputation can be assigned
- Re-written URL: when URL is revealed, protection server rewrites URL so user cannot simply type the malicious URL into a browser and access site
- Attachment defense: when attachment arrives, protection server analyzes before forwarding the message
