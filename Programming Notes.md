# Java  
## Intro to Java
- java programs and other programming have keywords
- Notes: keywords ARE case sensitive
- Public is an access modifier
- Access modifier: allows us to define the scope or how other parts of your code or even someone else's cide can access this code
- Class: used to define a class with the name following the keyword "{ }" defube the class block
- to define a class requires an optional access modifier, followed by class, followed by { }
- anything between { } is apart of the class data and code included
- Method? a collection of statments 1 or + that performs an operation
- Main method is entry point in any java code, java looks for it when running program
- Can create your own methods

- public is the access modifier
- Static will get to later
- Void the method will not return anything
- () needed for method declaration, can include one or more parameter
- String[] args is the parameter within the ()
- {} below main method is code block
- Code block is used to define a block of code, mandatory to have one in methind declaration
- System.out.println() is a statement
- statement is a complete command to be executed and include one or more expressions
- Variables are a way to store info on computer. variables can be accessed by a name we give them and computer figures out where it gets stored in RAM
- Variabel can be changed, just variable
- Multiple data types in keywords
- Int = integer a whole number
- To define variable need to specify data type, give name, and optionall add an expression
- declaration statement used to define variable by indication data type, and the name , and optionally set the variable to certain value

- the type is int, name is myFirstNumber and the value assigned or initialized to variable is 72. Declaring a variable of type int with name myFirstNumber and assigning the value 72 to it
- int myFirstNumber cna be changed to anything like so
- String literal is any sequence of characters surrounded by double quotes. Value cannot be changed not variable
- operators perform and operation on a variable or value + - / *. Lots more

- Primitive types: boolean, byte, char, short, int, long, float, double
- These building blocks of data manipulation
- Java packages are ways to organize java projects, consider as folders for now
- companies use domain names reversed learnprogramming.academy becomes academy.learnprogramming

- Java uses concept of Wraooer class for all 8 primitive types, int we use Integer, and by doing that it gives us wats to perform operations on an int
- Using Min_Value and Max_Value to get Java to tell us min and max range of numbers that can be stored
- Overflow more the max vualue and Underflow less than min. Causes computer to skip to the opposoite important concept
